<p>My name is Esther Ayo Isaiah. I’m a Biochemistry graduate from Federal University Dutsin-ma Katsina State, Nigeria. Over the years, I’ve grown to wear many hats from working in public health and education to customer service and tech. I’m currently studying Cloud Engineering at AltSchool Africa, where I’m learning to build scalable, secure, and resilient systems that power the digital world.
</p>
<p>My professional journey started with my internship at Kaduna State Water Corporation, where I worked on water quality and public safety. During my NYSC, I served at the Kogi State Ministry of Health and contributed to health outreach programs. These experiences deepened my love for helping people and solving problems that matter.
</p>
<p> I’ve also worked as a Customer Service Representative at Jobberman, helping job seekers and employers connect more effectively, and as an Administrative Assistant at Nile University, where I developed strong organizational and communication skills.
</p>
<p>  I enjoy exploring new things especially in tech, leadership, and personal growth. I’m fluent in English and Hausa, love watching movies, listening to music, and baking. Food is one of my love languages, and I always enjoy discovering new meals and flavors. I find joy in little things and peace in my own space.
</p>
<P>I'm driven by purpose and faith, and I believe in showing up as my best self even when it’s hard. Whether I’m working behind the scenes or taking the lead, I strive to bring clarity, kindness, and creativity into everything I do. My journey is still unfolding, but I’m excited for the path ahead.
